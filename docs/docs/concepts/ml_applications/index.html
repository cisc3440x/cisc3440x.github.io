  Machine learning is all around us
  #

Machine learning, is the science of getting computers to learn
without explicitly being programmed.
We will learn how to implement machine learning alogrithms
and how to make them perform well.
Many of us have used &ldquo;Large Language Models&rdquo; like chatgpt, Grok, and
Claude, but there are many times we may use machine learning
withou being aware of it.

Google uses machine learning to rank search results.
Instatgram or snap chat tagged with our pictures with friends names, thats machine learning.
Recomendation algorithms for similiar products from amazon and other
movies you may like from netflix are also machine learning
algorithms.
Voice to text functionality on your phone, to siri, or google or is machine learning.
Spam detection uses machine learning.
Targeted advertising uses machine learning.

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn
without explicitly being programmed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arthur Samuel, 1959</p></blockquote>
<p>Arthur Samuel wrote a machine learning algorithm in 1959 to teach a computer
to play checkers. His plan was to have the computer play 1000&rsquo;s of games of
checkers against itself to LEARN what the better POSITIONS were.</p>
<p>In general the more games the computer could play the more it would learn. If it only
played 10 games it would learn much less than play 10000.</p>
<p><strong>THE MORE YOU GIVE A LEARNING ALGORITHM THE OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN THE BETTER IT WILL PERFORM!!</strong></p>
