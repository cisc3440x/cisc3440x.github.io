Map inputs to outputs # Supervised Machine Learning refers to algorithms that learn Mappings from input to output. In other words given an x what is the y. Given the input what is the ouput.\ninput =\u0026gt; output x =\u0026gt; y B. Trains on Labeled Data # You train the learning algorithm by feeding it labeled data. Labeled data is a data set that includes correct examples of x =\u0026gt; y mappings.\nApplications # In all of the following application we would first train our models with examples of input x to correct output y mappings. After the model has been trained it can then take a brand new input x it has never seen before and try to predict the corresponding output y.\nEmail spam filters # Input(x) Output(y) email spam?(0,1) If the input x is an email and the output y is labeled as either\nspam not spam. Speech recognition # Input(x) Output(y) audio clip text If the input x is audio and the output is a printed string of text.\nMachine Translation # Input(x) Output(y) English text Spanish Text Online Advertising # Input(x) Output(y) ad, user info Click?(0,1) The algorithm will try and predict, given some info about a user wether they will.\nclick\nnot click\nan add.\nSelf Driving # Input(x) Output(y) image, radar info position of other cars Given an input image or radar info predict the position of other cars or obstructions.\nVisual Inspection in manufacturing # Input(x) Output(y) image of product defect?(0,1) Given an input image of a product off an assembly line output wether there is a defect or not.\nSupervised Learning Algorithms # REGRESSION Housing price prediction example # REGRESSION: we are trying to predict a number from infinite possiblities of numbers.\nSay you want to predict housing prices based on the size of the house. You collect real world data and graph it sqfeet(x) to=\u0026gt; price(y).\nTo make predictions you can try and FIT a straight line y = mx + b. to the data, and when asked how much a 750sq foot house should cost you can find the x,y coordinates of the line. That gives you the sqfoot to price relation. In this case using a line to fit the data, your algoritm would predict ~150k for the price of the house.\nYou may feel like a straight line is not accurate enough and want to use a more complex equation of a curve that fits the training data more accurately. If you make the prediction using the curve the price would be closer to 200k.\nThe idea is to find an equation that best fits the training data to give you the most accurate predictions.\nRemember: REGRESSION IS TRYING TO FIND A NUMBER OUT OF INFINITE POSSIBILITIES.\nCLASSIFICATION: breast cancer detection example # We can build a machine learning diagnostic tool to try and CLASSIFY a tumor as ( benign(0) | malignant(1) ). The idea is to use a patients medical data to predict one or the other.\nWe can collect medical data for a training set that plots size of tumor(x) to diagnosis(y). In the case of CLASSIFICATION we are trying to pick one out of 2 possible categories, either benign or malignant which we can specify as 0 and 1.\nIN classification there are only a small number of possible outputs or categories from which we are trying to predict from as opposed to regression which has an infinite set of possibilities.\nWe can also plot this data set on a single axis becuase there are a limited number of y\u0026rsquo;s for each x. That we can denote with the symbols (X O).\nIn classification algorithms, there may be more than 2 possilbe outcomes. We can have 3 possible output categories or classes as below.\nREMEMBER: CLASSIFCATION ALGORITHMS PREDICT CATEGORIES OR CLASSES(These are synonyms) and the OUTPUT is chosen from a small finite set of limited possible output categories/classes\nMulitiple Input Values # Supervised learning Algorithms can use more than one input for our data sets. For example: let\u0026rsquo;s say instead of just tumor size we also collect data on the patients age in years.\nWe can use the y coordinage for age and the x coordinate for tumor size and the symbols (X O) for malignant and benign tumors at any given age tumor size data point. We can then try and fit a curve or a line that acts as a boundary line between the groupings. In the example below the algorithm woudld predict that anything to the left of the pink line to be benign and to the right to be malignant.\nSupervised machine learning algorithms in the real world often us many inputs for their predictions. For example in predicting housing prices an algorithm may use.\nsize in sq feet number of bedrooms number of bathrooms zip code etc\u0026hellip; "},{"id":3,"href":"/docs/concepts/unsupervised_learning/","title":"Unsupervised Learning Algorithm","section":"Concepts","content":" What is Unsupervised Learning # In supervised learning data comes with\ninputs x output labels y In unsupervised learning data comes with\ninputs x The unsupervised algorithm job is to find some some pattern or structure in the data.\nIn unsupervised learning we are given the data set without any labels. The unsupervised algorithm is tasked with trying to find interesting patterns that are present in the data. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t look for any predifined particuliar category like a classfication algorithm or for a number like a regression algorithm.\nAs you can see below the data in the Unsupervised set is unlabeled. The algorithm just needs to figure out if some pattern exists in the data.\nUnsupervised Learning Algorithms # Clustering # One type of unsupervised algorithms is called a clustering algorithm because it looks for data points that can be grouped into clusters.\nClustering algorithms try and take data without labels and group it into clusters.\nIn the data set below we can see that the data can be grouped into two distinct Clusters. The type of an algorithm that does this kind of pattern recognition is called a Clustering Algorithm.\nClustering Examples # Google News # One example of clustering, is the way GOOGLE NEWS assembles it\u0026rsquo;s news feeds. Every day google news looks at Hundreds of thousands of articles and groups related stories together. Clustering these articles together is all done by an unsupervised clustering ml algorithm.\nThe algorithm looks for similiar words in articles and groups. Notice the words \u0026ldquo;panda\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;twin\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;zoo\u0026rdquo; appear in all the articles. So it finds articles that mentions similiar words and group them together. This algo figures out on its own which words suggest that articles belong in the same group. There is no human intervention.\nDNA microarry # The following image shows a table of columns and rows. Each column represents a person and each row is a different gene. The different color values show how much of that gene is active in a given person.\nThe clustering algorithm can group people with similiar gene characterstics into different types. remember the types are not specified before. There is no predefined training set that says people with these genes are type 1 and people with these are type 2. The algorithm finds the patterns of clusters by itself.\ngrouping customers # Many companies have large databases of customer information. Given this data the clustering algorithm can group the customers into different market segments,so the company can understand the different types of customers and their needs.\nIn the below example DeepLearning.ai tried to understand why students were taking it\u0026rsquo;s classes.\nAnomaly Detection/Dimensionality reduction. # These are two additional algorithms we will discuss further as the course goes on.\nAnomaly Detection # Used to detect unusual events. Used for fraud detection in the financial system.\nDimensionality reduction. # Lets you take a big data set and compress it a much smaller data set without loosing the important detail.\nReview Question # Which type of machine learning algorithms should we use f of the following applications ?\n"},{"id":4,"href":"/docs/concepts/","title":"Concepts","section":"Docs","content":" ML Applications # Machine learning is all around us # Machine learning, is the science of getting computers to learn without explicitly being programmed.\nWe will learn how to implement machine learning alogrithms and how to make them perform well.\nMany of us have used \u0026ldquo;Large Language Models\u0026rdquo; like chatgpt, Grok, and Claude, but there are many times we may use machine learning withou being aware of it.\nGoogle uses machine learning to rank search results.
